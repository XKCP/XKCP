The Keccak Code Package

This project gathers different implementations of the Keccak sponge function family. Its purpose is to replace the implementations originally in the "Keccak Reference and Optimized Code in C" with cleaner and more flexible code following the interface proposed in the note "A software interface for Keccak".

This version supports the hash and extendable output functions defined in the FIPS 202 draft (http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/hash/sha-3/sha-3_standard_fips202.html).

More information can be found:
* on the proposed software interface at http://keccak.noekeon.org/NoteSoftwareInterface.pdf
* on Keccak in general at http://keccak.noekeon.org/

Code contributions are welcome.

To build, the following tools are needed:
* GCC
* make
* xsltproc
